This is just a simple ecnryption project im working on for my software security class, the funtions of this code will basically be accessible by my teacher and classmates.
This will be using a level system to determine the users permissions for example: Administrator (All Perms), User (Just perms to use the encryption components).
All of this is a work in progress and will be updating the readme and comments in code accoriding to the progress i make throughtout the journey of this project.

Stay tuned for more!!!!
